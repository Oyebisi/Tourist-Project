        <h4>For people who are tired of nature, or for those who just like shopping and bargains, Balogun Market on Lagos Island would be a 
        perfect place to visit. Did you know? This market is considered one of the biggest in the whole of West Africa. It is so big that it 
        does not even have a definite address. It stretches across several streets, and sometimes, it seems that it never ends. The market 
        is open every day from 7 am to 8.30 pm, so you will have plenty of time to find something you like and get it at a great price.

        <h4>This park, otherwise known as the Yankari Game Reserve, is too beautiful for words to describe. On an area of more than
        2,000 square kilometres, you can watch animals in their natural environment, enjoy the wonderful nature of the savannah 
       or simply relax after long months of work. Yankari National Park would be a great destination for people who enjoy ecotourism. 
       Visitors of the park can climb the many hills or watch elephants, lions, monkeys and many other animals, who are able to live freely. 
       You can find the park in the Bauchi State, 225 km east of Jos.

        <h4>At first glance, this large rock might not look like something great. However, it has a long and fascinating history you can learn about 
            when you get there. To get you excited to find out more about it, you should know that Olumo Rock used to be a fortress for Egba 
            people in the 19th century. The name of the city where it is located, Abeokuta, literally translates as ‘under the rock’. It is located in the heart of Abeokuta,
             the capital of Ogun State, so you would also be able to explore the city while you get to the Rock.

        <h4>If you find parks, rocks and markets boring, you should give Ogbunike Caves a try. Located in Ogbunike, Anambra State, the site consists
            of numerous caves. Local people have always considered this location to have a deep spiritual significance. Thus, visitors of the caves 
           have to take their shoes off before entering.  The cave system is strewn with streams, rivers and small lakes. It is populated by various bats,
            so bat lovers will definitely enjoy this place. The area surrounding the caves is covered with thick rainforests. The whole site is absolutely 
           fantastic and definitely worth the visit.

        <h4>For those who want to experience the history of their people, we recommend visiting Badagry. But beware, your journey might be darker
            than you expect. This town is infamous for being the epicentre of African slave trade. It still bears the 17th century wells, barracoons, 
           slave shackles and, most importantly, the slave route titled ‘The Point Of No Return’. You can find this small town in Lagos State.

        <h4>Otherwise known as Oke Idandre, this natural landscape is one of the most beautiful in Nigeria. It consists of several cultural sites, 
            including Owa’s Palace and the Shrines. The hill rises high above the sea level, reaching almost a kilometre in height. The view from 
            the top is simply to die for. When you get to the hill, you can see an ancient tree at its entrance. It is called Iraye Tree. What is also 
            interesting about this location is that it has a spot on the UNESCO World Heritage list, so you know it is a real deal. You can see the 
            hill in Idandre, Ondo State.

            (and not the other Tinubu you might have thought about). She was a significant woman in the pre-colonial times, 
           both in politics and in the slave trading business. The square itself is a beautiful open space located on Broad Street, 
           Lagos. It has two sparkling fountains and several monuments, including the full-sized statue of Madam Tinubu.

            2,419 metres.  Mambilla Plateau also has lush vegetation. Some trees and plants that grow there can be considered 
            exotic for Nigeria as a whole. Even the drive to the plateau could be a fun experience on its own, as the road is winding
             and bordered by cliffs.

        <h4>This place is one of the most peculiar spots on our list. The small town of Ikogosi located in Ekiti state became famous because of this 
            natural phenomenon. It has a place where a warm spring meets a cold spring, but the two springs manage to somehow maintain their 
            respective temperatures. But wait, there is more: This occurrence is one ofa kind both in Nigeria and in the whole world. You should
             definitely go there and experience it for yourself. You can stay at a resort near the spring, which will allow you to enjoy the scenery for
             longer than just one day.
