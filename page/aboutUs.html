        <h3>For the uninitiated, eBooks are digital books that are published online. They're a fast-growing segment of 
            publishing and reading, with millions of users buying and downloading eBooks every day. In fact, in 2017 
            the eBook market generated an estimated $3 billion in sales. If you have a great idea for a book but don’t 
            know where to start, this how-to will provide you with everything you need to know about self-publishing
             your own eBook on Amazon. This article covers what eBooks are and why they might be worth your while as 
             an author; how to choose the right platform for your work; how to format your manuscript so it’s ready to 
             be uploaded; what copyrighting is and why it matters; and finally tips on promoting your book once it’s 
             live on Amazon.
        </h3>
        <h3>If you’re an author, chances are you want to write a book. Perhaps it’s your first book, or perhaps it’s the
             first in a series. Either way, you want to know how to publish and promote your eBook on Amazon so that you
              can share your ideas with the world. Publishing an eBook is easier than ever before thanks to self-publishing
               sites like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing. You can upload your document and cover image and have an e-book 
               ready for sale in less than a day. Whether you’re uploading your first novel, or looking for tips on how to
                promote it further once it’s available digitally, this guide will tell you everything you need to know 
                about publishing and promoting eBooks on Amazon—from initial set-up to marketing details.
           </h3>
           <h3>It’s no secret that the world is going digital. These days, almost everything we read is in an electronic
             format, rather than on paper. With e-reading apps available on nearly every device and e-readers like the 
             Kindle becoming ever more popular, it’s not just books that are moving to digital formats – but also the 
             market for physical books themselves. That’s why you should consider self-publishing an eBook to sell online
              and offline. Not only will it open up a whole new audience for your book, but it can also drive sales of 
              your print version too. This blog post will take you through all you need to know about self-publishing an 
              eBook and helping it sell like hot cakes.
            </h3>
            <h3>Creating an e-book is the first step in your journey to becoming a successful self-published author. 
                However, if you want people to read it, you’ll need to do more than just upload it to the internet. 
                You’ll need to market and promote your e-book so that as many people as possible can find it and read 
                it. Fortunately, self-publishing your e-book on the Amazon platform makes this process much easier than
                 it would be with any other company. This blog post will teach you everything you need to know about how 
                 to publish and promote your eBook on Amazon in order to make sure that as many readers as possible can 
                 find and buy your book.
            </h3>
            <h3>What does it take to become an author, release your own book, and get it in front of as many people as 
                possible? Let’s find out. There are more authors than ever before, thanks in part to the rise of 
                e-readers like the Kindle and other tablets. With so much competition in this space, you need to stand 
                out from the rest if you want people to notice your book. There are a lot of ways that you can publish 
                and market an eBook on Amazon. Some of these would be considered ‘self-publishing’ and others aren’t 
                quite as black-and-white. But whichever path you choose, there will be challenges ahead.
